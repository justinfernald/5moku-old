# 5moku

This is a Gomoku game created by Justin in a day-ish for
fun. This was a test using peer to peer networking which
allows for this game to run with live multiplier without
a external server.

Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game and is also
called Five in a Row. It is traditionally played on a
board with size 19x19. However, because once placed,
pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku
may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game
is known in several countries under different names. The
name Gomoku comes from the Japanese language, in which
it is referred to as gomokunarabe. Go means five, moku
is a counter word for pieces and narabe means line-up.
