                        This is a Gomoku game created by Justin in a day-ish for
                        fun. This was a test using peer to peer networking which
                        allows for this game to run with live multiplier without
                        a external server.

                        Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game and is also
                        called Five in a Row. It is traditionally played on a
                        board with size 19x19. However, because once placed,
                        pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku
                        may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game
                        is known in several countries under different names. The
                        name Gomoku comes from the Japanese language, in which
                        it is referred to as gomokunarabe. Go means five, moku
                        is a counter word for pieces and narabe means line-up.
